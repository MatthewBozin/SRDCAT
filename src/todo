worldstate -> scene

scene imports top level location modifiers and props(?) from list

PERSONAS
-TC or player
-will help transition to websockets
-button next to SRDCAT title swaps between?

TC: worldstate available instead of character sheet
-skills/traits/spells are not invisible
-locations/props are visible

-Change persona only from home screen

COMMAND LINE
-actions can generate snippets of pseudocode that dms and players can share
-inputting the pseudocode into the command line will cause an action
-ex: creature attacks player, which generates pseudocode:
damage 10, save THO 18
dm sends pseudocode to player
player inputs into their command line:
SRDcat immediately subtracts 10 from their life and rolls a THO save with target 18
-CAN BE UPGRADED TO WEBSOCKET EVENTS

examples:
damage 10, save THO 18: damage 3
function splits by ", " to determine individual actions
then splits by keywords like "or" or "else" (or most likely ": ") to determine conditionals
then splits by " " to parse for functions and parameters
special function words like "damage" or "save" trigger specific functions
words after functions words are treated as parameters

THIS MEANS THE APP CAN RUN ITS OWN PSEUDOCODE COMMANDS
for instance, as random roll result

card modal: literally a modal that contains a functional card (harvest from CardList?)
table: if (typeof result === "object") {display card modal}
this way, tables can properly link to other cards without disrupting the user's place
button option to display table as list?
