PERSONAS
-TC or player
-will help transition to websockets
-button next to SRDCAT title swaps between?

TC: worldstate available instead of character sheet

COMMAND LINE
-actions can generate snippets of pseudocode that dms and players can share
-inputting the pseudocode into the command line will cause an action
-ex: creature attacks player, which generates pseudocode:
damage 10, save THO 18
dm sends pseudocode to player
player inputs into their command line:
SRDcat immediately subtracts 10 from their life and rolls a THO save with target 18
-CAN BE UPGRADED TO WEBSOCKET EVENTS

examples:
damage 10, save THO 18 or damage 3
function splits by ", " to determine individual actions
then splits by keywords like "or" to determine conditionals
then splits by " " to parse for functions and parameters
special function words like "damage" or "save" trigger specific functions
words after functions words are treated as parameters
